# Hollow Knight: Fallen Hopes
- Hollow Knight: Fallen Hopes is an extension to the original Hollow Knight game, which is highly recommended to have played before going into this 'DLC', since most of the content it includes is advanced, not necessarily in a sense of accessibility, but on terms of skill requirement and game knowledge. However, there are other features to still be accessed.
